# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining
## Homework 1
### Due: 25/10/2020, 23:59


This repository gathers the two problems of the first homework of the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course at the Sapienza University of Rome.


**Problem 1.** The goal of the first assignment focused on building up my skills on Python. The assignment is done electronically using the HACKERRANK online service available from the following URL: https://www.hackerrank.com. Among the main themes tackled in this problem there is Data Types, Strings, Sets, Collections, Date and Time, Exceptions, Built-in, Python Functionals, XML and Numpy.

**Problem 2.** We continue in this question with the implementation of some algorithms in Python, by resolving 6 different algorithmic problems.

I chose to save these two problems in a Jupyter Notebook, because it enabled me to add explanations and titles before every code, therefore improving my presentation and making it easier to read and correct.
The stamp file contains screens of all my Hackerrank submissions.
