# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining
## Homework 1
### Due: 25/10/2020, 23:59


This repository gathers the two problems of the first homework of the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course at the Sapienza University of Rome.


**Problem 1.** The goal of the first assignment focused on building up my skills on Python. The assignment is done electronically using the HACKERRANK online service available from the following URL: https://www.hackerrank.com. Among the main themes tackled in this problem there is Data Types, Strings, Sets, Collections, Date and Time, Exceptions, Built-in, Python Functionals, XML and Numpy.

**Problem 2.** We continue in this question with the implementation of some algorithms in Python, by resolving 6 different algorithmic problems.

I chose to save these two problems in a Jupyter Notebook, because it enabled me to add explanations and titles before every code, therefore improving my presentation and making it easier to read and correct.
The stamp file contains screens of all my Hackerrank submissions.

I would also comment that a lot of these problems were not clear and had ambiguous explanations. I often had to consult forums and look for direct answers do these problems online in order to understand what I was asked. Moreover a lot of submissions were given wrong for no other reason that a wrong format or a space lacking at the end of a word, which was probably the most annoying part. I sometimes spent more time understanding the output format than writing my code.

Other than that this was a good reminder of python basics, and I discovered a few new features I didn't know existed.
